# About
This is hobby project that aims to establish a website for peers of mine. 
I started the project using Ember.js which was appealing in the beginning but a hassle 
when it came to set up a proper component lifecycle for a Map component using third party libraries. 
This is the old repo: https://github.com/geomC/strehlow-ember.

Furthermore, this new start incorporates what I have learned developing for [FixMyBerlin](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/fixmy.frontend).

As development boiler plate, [webkidÂ´s React Starterkit](https://github.com/wbkd/react-starter) is used, thanks guys!
